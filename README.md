# Poetry Generator Utilizing RNN Markov

## Overview

This project introduces a sophisticated poetry generation system that combines Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Markov Chains. The system aims to generate new verses inspired by input poems while preserving the style and thematic elements of the source material. It leverages techniques from natural language processing and machine learning to create engaging and stylistically consistent compositions.

## Features

- **RNN and Markov Integration**: The system combines the power of RNNs and Markov Chains to generate verses with rhyming patterns and stylistic coherence.
  
- **Customization Options**: Users can customize various parameters such as syllable count, rhyme scheme, and thematic focus to tailor the generated poetry to their preferences.
  
- **Versatile Output**: The system can produce poetry across different genres and styles, catering to diverse creative needs and artistic endeavors.
  
- **Training on Renowned Artists**: To illustrate its capabilities, the system is trained on the poetry of renowned artists such as Notorious B.I.G. and Lil Wayne, utilizing their vocabulary and rhyme structures to craft new compositions.

## Usage

To use the poetry generator:

1. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
2. Prepare your input text files containing collections of poems or song lyrics.
3. Run the generator script, providing the path to the input text files.
4. Customize the output parameters as desired to generate poetry tailored to your preferences.
